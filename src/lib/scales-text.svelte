				We define a key or mode as a sequence of 17 perfect fifths:
				<ul class="list-[square] pl-4">
					<li>7 diatonic scale degrees.</li>
					<li>5 chromatically raised degrees.</li>
					<li>5 chromatically lowered degrees.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				We stop at 17 because <span

					>well-behaved</span
				>
				chromatic notes resolve by
				<span
					class="underline decoration-stone-200 decoration-dotted underline-offset-4 sm:underline-offset-5 xl:underline-offset-6"
					>diatonic half-step</span
				> in the direction of their alteration (e.g. C# -&gt; D in C major). Further extensions would
				have nowhere to correctly resolve to, and produce enharmonics with unaltered scale degrees.
			</li>
			<li>
				Beginning with C major, we can continue by fifth to define seven more keys in either
				direction, up to C# and down to Cb major (likewise for their associated modes) before
				exhausting the notes defined by the 31-tone system.
